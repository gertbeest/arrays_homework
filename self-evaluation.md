How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?
    -I feel pretty good, and much better about it than yesterday. I feel silly that I freaked out over something that isn't insanely difficult to understand when I calm down and take a moment to really think about it.

Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?
    -I don't think so - I feel like my arrays knowledge is sufficient for tonight's work. I might feel a lot differently when I get to the other homeworks and see that they're a little more complicated, maybe, but for now my understanding seems pretty good.

What questions do you have about Arrays?
    -I don't think I know enough about them to have any real technical questions. Maybe - I would wonder how huge arrays might work. Or how complicated they can get.
